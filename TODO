1. Add a replace function to replace all instances of an atom with another atom.
   - used in splitting algorithm
   - implement both an in-place and non in-place call.
2. Implement syntatic simplification.
3. Implement splitting algorithm
4. Implement index operator for getting sub formulas
5. Implement polarity checking for a subformula
6. Implement is_pure(atom) - maybe one that walks the whole tree and gathers the purity of all atoms.
7. Pure Atom simplification.

Maybes:
- Attempt to replace recursive algorithms with stack based ones.
- Introduce a new position struct with a constructor from string e.g., Position pi("1.2.1");

Structural Changes:
- for associative operators || and && make the formula keep a set of all Formulas instead of a large tree of formulas.

Reminders:
- no need for to_string, can just yeet it into a stringstream ðŸ‘Œ
